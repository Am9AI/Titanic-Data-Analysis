# Titanic - Data Analysis Project ðŸš¢

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**:  
This is my **first data analysis project** where I explore the Titanic dataset using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. The goal is to analyze survival patterns based on age, gender, and passenger class.



## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure:
- `Titanic_Analysis.html`: Complete notebook with code and visualizations.
- `Titanic_Presentation.pdf`: Summary presentation of insights and visuals.
- `charts/`: Folder with exported images from the analysis.



## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib



## ðŸ§  Key Insights:
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate.
- Younger passengers had higher chances of survival.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
